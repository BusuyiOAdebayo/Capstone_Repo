        Hi guys! I am a chemical process modeling, simulation and optimization
        engineer (BSc in Mathematics and BSc, MSc and PhD in Chemical
        Engineering) with extensive lab capabilities and a wide breadth of
        knowledge in material & process development,
        mechanistic/physics-based/first-principles and
        surrogate/statistical/data-based (AI, ML & DL) modeling, simulation and
        optimization with focus on adsorptive (separation and purification),
        catalytic and pharmaceutical operations. My solid foundation in
        Mathematics coupled with my over a decade of experience in chemical,
        biochemical and biological process modeling, simulation and optimization
        has afforded me opportunity to be able to proficiently use various
        related process modeling software such as MATLAB, COMSOL, CHEMCAD, ASPEN
        Plus, Hysys and Custom Modeler, gPROMS (ModelBuilder, ProcessBuilder and
        FormulatedProducts) and also markup, programming, scripting and query
        languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, FORTRAN, Python, C/C#/C++,
        Java, SQL and NoSQL building web, desktop and mobile apps. I am insanely
        interested in advanced chemical, biochemical and biological process
        modeling, simulation, optimization and control using empirical
        (data-driven/based, statistical, probabilistic, AI/ML/DL), mechanistic
        (first-principles, physics-driven/based) and hybrid/surrogate
        approaches. I also have exceptional knowledge in the use of density
        functional theory, atomistic/molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
        simulations.
